Kafka-UI Project Roadmap
====================

Roadmap exists in a form of a github project and is located [here](https://github.com/provectus/kafka-ui/projects/8).

### How to use this document

The roadmap provides a list of features we decided to prioritize in project development. It should serve as a reference point to understand projects' goals.

The roadmap sets the general way of development. The roadmap is mostly about long-term features. All the features could be re-prioritized, rescheduled or canceled.
If there's no feature `X`, that doesn't mean we're not going to implement it. Feel free to raise the issue for the consideration.


### How to contribute

Since the roadmap consists mostly of big long-term features, implementing them might be not easy for a beginner outside collaborator.

A good starting point is checking [issues](https://github.com/provectus/kafka-ui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) labeled with `good first issue`. They're generally good to go for everyone.
